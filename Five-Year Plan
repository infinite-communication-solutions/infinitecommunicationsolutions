Long-Term Goals and Vision

Infinite Communications Solutions will initally deploy its reviews service in the Omaha market with a focus on the dining and restaurant scene, but we expect to expand our reviews to other local businesses, including nightlife, clothing stores, and pet stores, within the first year. Additionally, we expect to expand into other underserved areas nationwide, particularly small and mid-size cities, in a two- to three-year time frame depending on our success in our home market. As we develop trust with consumers and relationships with businesses, we expect to leverage our branding to enter into new and unique marketing partnerships, including sponsored products, affiliated events, and new-business launches. In the long-term, we also hope to incorporate customer feedback for businesses in a dynamic way, helping customers regularly and agilely rework their offerings in response to consumer demands.
