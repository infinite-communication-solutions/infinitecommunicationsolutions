As a blog that reviews local Omaha businesses, restaurants, and venues, our main customer segment is the places we review. By talking about their business and reviewing it for our readers, we advertise for them and increase their visiters and business.
Therefore, without readers and social media followers, our business is dead, as we serve no use in advertisement. Because of this, our main customer channel will be social media. By posting about the places and businesses we visit and linking our blog, Infinite Communication Solutions can create a following which leads to businesses (our customers) wanting us to advertise for them. When a large number of people will see our positive review of a spot in Omaha, they will want to experience that for themselves. Clearly this creates more business for our customer. 
Any business can reach out to us for a review, or we may initiate business ourselves. In terms of a business evaluating our services, the larger our company gets, the more evident it will be, due to the increase of new customers that particular business will get.
