As a blog that reviews local Omaha businesses, restaurants, and venues, our main customer segment is the places we review. 
By talking about their business and reviewing it for our readers, we advertise for them and increase their visiters and business.
Therefore, without readers and social media followers, our business is dead, as we serve no use in advertisement. 
Because of this, our main customer channel will be social media.  
The advantages of also starting with social media are:
  * Customers can leave their experience on the comment's section on a post our company makes 
  * They can also reccommend our company to their friends which broads our company's name 
  * Our company would be making daily posts about our blogs to attract the customers and inviting them 
  to read our full review on our blog
Our company's blog will offer a complete review with pictures and ratings of every local place we visit in Omaha. 
As our company keeps expanding, we would create a compaqy email to keep recommending places to our customers based 
on what they enjoy. 
We will also include our company's own phone line for customers that prefer calling, and texting for customers 
that prefer messaging. 
Our customers can purchase via the company's website and their products will be delivered to the address they offer.
