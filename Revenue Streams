In order to diversify our business, we plan on having multiple revenue streams. Our main streams of revenue will come from building our brand through reviews of businesses and products.
By partnering with businesses and reviewing them for a fee, we gain revenue. The same goes for our product reviews. By partnering with online retailers and posting and reviewing their products on our page,
we send new customers their way. When people click the link on our page and buy that product, we will receive 10% of that sale.
Lastly, as our website and our brand grows, we will expand our business with merchandise. By selling merchandise with our brand name,
we get another stream of revenue to further diversify our business.
