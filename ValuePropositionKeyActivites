Our business is based entirely on creating a relationship with local business and those people who may visit these places. 
We will do this by creating a unique blog and social media accounts that allow us to interact with the people we want to market to. 
We will be solving customer problems by providing reviews and information on local establishments in Omaha, and helping them find a good place that best fits their needs. 
We will be developing and maintaining platforms- our blog website and our social media pages. 
These platforms give us the best opportunity to interact with people that will help us grow our business, so it is extremely important that we keep our platforms well maintained, updated, and easy to use.
