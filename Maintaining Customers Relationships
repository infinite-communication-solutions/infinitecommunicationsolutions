    We expect a good relationship with our customers. We want our customers to feel free to express their opinions about 
certain products and we will be adapting to their requests. As the customer notices we are seeing and offering their requests, 
as well as offering them great service, we can retain our customers and up-sell our products if we encourage our current customers
to keep promoting us. Allowing customers to participate in the process of evaluating and changing a few aspects of the company
will allow them to stay because we're giving them the chance to express themselves and allowing them to view that we care about
what they request.
