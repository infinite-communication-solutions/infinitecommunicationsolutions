Using social media as our way to communicate with customers can connect us to any generation that uses the famous bases. 
The advantages of also starting with social media are:
  * Customers can leave their experience on the comment's section on a post our company makes 
  * They can also reccommend our company to their friends which broads our company's name 
  * Our company would be making daily posts about our blogs to attract the customers and inviting them 
  to read our full review on our blog
Our company's blog will offer a complete review with pictures and ratings of every local place we visit in Omaha. 
As our company keeps expanding, we would create a compaqny email to keep recommending places to our customers based 
on what they enjoy. 
We will also include our compnay's own phone line for customers that prefer calling, and texting for customers 
that prefer messaging.
