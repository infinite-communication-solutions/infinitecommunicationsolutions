ICS will need a variety of business partners as we grow our dining and retail reviewing company:

Local restaurants (and other local lifestyle businesses): Partnering with local restaurants is among the most important aspects of our business. These businesses give us access to resources by allowing us to review their products, which we can then share with our loyal readers. Additionally, the royalties we incur from businesses for our recommendations are an important revenue source.

Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.): By allowing us to quickly and easily connect with our readers, social media companies are providing us a service, performing a key activity for our brand, and reducing the cost of communicating with our audience. Social media companies are an integral part of any modern business, and this partnership improves out operations in multiple ways.

Local Newspapers and TV Networks (Omaha World-Herald, KETV, etc.): Much like social media, traditional media provides services (mainly marketing) for our company.

Wix.com: Using a service to host our website allows us to reduce costs by offloading some key software development work to an expert third party, rather than hiring our own engineers. Wix also provides us a service by grandly simplifying our development needs.
